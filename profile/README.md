## Hi there 👋

**Welcome to the ICAT Project organization in GitHub**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - The ICAT project provides a metadata catalogue and related components to support experimental data management for large-scale facilities, linking all aspects of the research lifecycle from proposal through to data and articles publication.

🌈 ICAT collaboration - This project is run by a collaboration of multiple large-scale facilities across the world and you can find more details about the collaboration [here](https://icatproject.org/collaboration). We meet regularly so get in touch if you would like to join our meetings. 


👩‍💻 Useful resources - There is documentation for each of the components and it can be found on the [website](https://icatproject.org/user-documentation). You can find tutorials on how to install the tools in the [ICAT Manual](https://github.com/icatproject/icat.manual/tree/master/tutorials).
